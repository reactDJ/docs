# Self-hosted Deployment Guide

This guide will help you set up a self-hosted deployment of your application.

## Prerequisites
- A server with at least 2GB of RAM.
- Docker installed on the server.
- Access to the domain name for your application.

## Steps to Deploy
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Use the following command to clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Change into the directory of your project:  
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Build the Docker Image**  
   Run the following command to build your Docker image:  
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-app-name .
   ```

4. **Run the Docker Container**  
   Start a new container instance from your image:  
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 80:80 your-app-name
   ```

5. **Configure Domain Settings**  
   Point your domain to the IP address of your server.

6. **Check Deployment**  
   Visit your domain in a web browser to see your app in action!  

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter issues, check the Docker logs for more information:
```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```
