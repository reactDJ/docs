# Agents Concept

Agents refer to autonomous entities that can perceive their environment, act upon that environment, and have the ability to learn and adapt. In the context of software and systems, agents are often used as components that can operate independently, make decisions, and interact with other agents or systems.

## Key Characteristics of Agents
1. **Autonomy**: Agents operate independently without human intervention.
2. **Perception**: They can perceive their environment through sensors.
3. **Actuation**: Agents can act on their environment through effectors.
4. **Learning**: Many agents incorporate learning capabilities to improve their effectiveness over time.

## Applications
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Used in AI applications for decision-making and problem-solving.
- **Robotics**: Agents control robotic operations, enabling them to perform tasks in various environments.
- **Distributed Systems**: They enable autonomous communication and operations in systems designed to operate over a network.

By understanding the behavior and capabilities of agents, developers can design more sophisticated systems that can intelligently interact with their environments and other entities.
